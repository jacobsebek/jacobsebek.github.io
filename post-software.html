We now use mind-expanding devices in more and more aspects of our lives - long
since it was just work, just education, and just entertainment. At the dawn of
the third millennium, the software industry keeps booming like never before, with no end in
sight. But with this accelerating intertwining and undisputable dependence of
billions on digital technology, developers no longer descry darkness at the end of the
tunnel.  The thought entering the mind is slowly crumpled in the nervous palms.
The shadow turns around to peek into the wet eye and the cold air starts
tickling the chest from bottom up.

<em>"What is this place?"</em> - the voice utters.

The ever-strengthening waves evoked by the violent thunder of over half a
century of computation have rocked
the ark farther from the shore than any naked man can cross. Watching it whiten in the
distance, the drunken sailors had lost all course and wandered about the deck.
They didn't see what was coming, and not because they couldn't, but only as a result
of their blind drunkenness.

Engineering is dead. The works of our fathers - taunted. The rabid Chihuahuas
don't cherish elegance and function - chaos and razed fields are found by the
sunrays.
Gifted with the golden fish of computer science remain but bones and blood of
software engineering. 
        </p>
        <p>
And there they are! Paddling away from the shore, this time, their arms nearly
tearing off!

What do the Sapiens do about their precarious situation? The philosophy of
computation has been solved in the 20th century. The key ideas were left here
for them to embrace - and it is only up to them if they listen or not.

They don't seem to. In fact, they celebrate the opposite. Emerge perfected
paradigms - designed to maximize the output of noodle programme logic at full capacity. 
        </p>
        <p>
Remove code, remove logic. Destroy complexity, destroy ambiguity. Erase the
diagram, shrink the problem, and conquer it. Conquer your megalomaniac and watch
computation become great again.
        </p>
        <p>
Pierce a small hole in the feasting behemoth. Watch it groan and stomp. Watch it
stumble for the last time in the human world. The body falls to your feet like a
huge trunk. Make this the last time we hear about it. Sit around, look up at the 
stars, and watch software engineering bleed, bleed, and finally, die.
