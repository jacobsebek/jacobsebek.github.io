<h2>Some random shit</h2>
<em>Fri May 6 2022, Jakub Sebek</em>
<br><br>

<p>
Recently I delved into the world of <a href="">some bullshit</a> and I'm
thrilled to share my bullshit experience with you. Are you still here? Bullshit
remark aside, "what kind of bullshit is he writing about <em>today</em>" you ask?
Random ecstatic exclamation! Well, I've always been interested in learning more
about bullshit so I thought to myself that it was finally the time.
</p>
<h3>Still waiting for your break to end?</h3>
<p>
I will dedicate this second paragraph to the question of why I am even writing 
about this random bullshit. And when we're at it, why not picture it as a bullet list:
<ul>
    <li>People are genuinely interested in my bullshit!</li>
    <li>I don't have anything better to do than write about this bullshit</li>
    <li>Third element dreaming of relevance</li>
</ul>
As you can see, I feel the urge to further address this bullshit question before 
ending the paragraph. So here's a bullshit sentence and a <a href="">hyperlink</a>.
</p>
<h3>Suggestive inquiry to the reader?</h3>
<p>
Never heard of bullshit, even though I linked it in the first section? That's
okay! This paragraph whose role is explaining what bullshit is like to a five
year old is for you (in reality, it's the following one).
</p>
<p>
Now, most people probably haven't heard of bullshit, and I think that's a shame!
Bullshit is a fascinating bullshit that I've used ever since I discovered it. It
has got some flaws, but we'll get to those in a few P tags. What immensely
helped me in getting started with bullshit was <a href="">a guide from some
fucking guy</a> (definitely check it out before reading on).
</p>
<p>
But well, in short, bullshit is characterized by <strong>strong
bullshit</strong>, <strong>secondary descriptor</strong> and <em>elegant
feature</em>. Some bullshit is the reason I chose to work with it, and why I
think you should too.
</p>
<h3>Is bullshit worth it?</h3>
<p>
I've talked to a few people about bullshit, and I've seen mixed impressions. As
<a href="">French name's article on the bullshit</a> says: <q>There isn't really
much about bullshit I can say, after all, I'm French.</q>
</p>
<p>
<em>While I do agree with this to an extent, there are some important points I'd
like to lay down as well as end this awkwardly long emphasis.</em> First of
all, it's not like bullshit always does that, and as I say, pessimism never
helps <em>anyone</em>. I don't know if I like emphases or exclamations more!
</p>
<p>
<small>Nothing is perfect, but the last thing I'd want is some random people on reddit
telling me my bullshit isn't perfect.</small>
</p>
<h3>Follow about three excessively long arguments</h3>
<p>
<strong>Bullshit does some shit</strong> - This is the <em>most common</em>
concern about bullshit I've heard, and while I will admit that it's essentialy
true, I wouldn't say it has much truth to it, and here are my arguments to
support the claim:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Secondly, when you look at bullshit from its roots and do some bullshit mental
gymnastics, you will come to agree with me.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Made up problem</strong> - Do you feel like I don't have anything more to
talk about at this point? Well, not really, and here is a bullshit two-node diagram to prove it:
</p>
<img src="bullshit_diagram.png"/>
<p>
Let's just get it straight. People who know bullshit about will know what I'm talking about. 
I received an email from a reader once who said some bullshit and I responded
by saying some shit - I hope that serves as a good example of the bullshit I'm
talking about.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Something is missing</strong>, of course, it's a crude graph that
doesn't make any sense. Another thing that's missing is my girlfriend.
</p>
<img src="bullshit_graph.png"/>
<p>
As we can see in the graph, the bullshit is really tremendous. This graph is
either completely unnecessary, or you can deduce all of its implications
yourself; but don't worry, I'm here to explain it anyway!
</p>
<p>
One thing that surprised me the most while making this bullshit was how much
there really is to do. You would think this is bullshit for a few
paragraphs, or that I should even keep it completely for myself, but as the
graph shows, the results differ exponentially from what one might expect.
</p>
<p>
So far I've been at least tolerable, so here are more of my tricks. Now I will
completely and seemingly deliberately misuderstand the matter of the bullshit,
subsequently provide a ridiculously simplistic solution to the bullshit created
in orders of minutes by my simplistic brain and call it a day.
</p>
<h3><q>He's just saying some bullshit!</q></h3>
<p>
While I understand this attitude that you might be having while reading my blog,
I would argue otherwise. It can be hard to admit some bullshit to ourselves.
If this is what you feel, what I would recommend is some bullshit and for you to
read <a href="">coping with some shit</a> from Germanic name Polish surname, 
who's a great friend of mine.
</p>
<p>
Now, this article is obviously about me and my opinion on said bullshit.
However, I will not elaborate on this matter because I am, to be honest, not
really qualified to be writing about bullshit. This is where my argument ends, because, 
well, we just have different opinions, and that's how it's supposed to be! :3
(you should really change yours though)
</p>
<h3>Forced conclusion</h3>
<p>
So here it is! I showed you my journey through bullshit and I hope I inspired
someone to do bullshit too. The great thing about bullshit is its ability to do
some other shit which I would never expect. Guess we all learn from some
bullshit every day! 
</p>
<p>
While this does feel like writing an english essay with a low bound word count,
I can assure you the bullshit isn't like that. You might be asking why this
article even has a conclusion section when there's clearly nothing to conclude.
You're <em>wrong</em>.
<p>
Either way, this was time very well spent both for me and for you. If you made
it this far, I would definitely recommend you to check out <a href="">similar
bullshit</a>.
</p>

If you like my blog, please share it, <a href="">read my other bullshit</a> or send 
me <a href="">an email</a>! See you next week with more bullshit from my life!
